> Create personalized stories from your own images, or see yourself as the hero in magical narratives â€” powered by LLMs, image generation, and face swapping!

### Before exploring the project, please check out the project demo. This will give you a better understanding of the experience.

In the "Pick to Tale" section, I selected four different images and created an imaginary story around them.

In the "Hero Time â€“ Face Swapping" section, I used a Superman story and swapped the hero's face with Shah Rukh Khan's for a clearer and more engaging demonstration.

## Overview

This platform transforms storytelling into a **highly interactive and personalized experience** using AI. Users can choose between:

1. **Image-Based Story Generation** â€“ Upload your own photos (art, sketches, family pics, etc.) and generate custom, coherent stories scene-by-scene.
2. **Face-Swapped Story Adventures** â€“ Upload a personal photo and become the main character in prewritten or custom stories.

The final story is generated with vivid illustrations and can be downloaded as a PDF storybook.
